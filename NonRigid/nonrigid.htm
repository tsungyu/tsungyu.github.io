			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<div><font size='4' face="times new roman">When a deforming object is captured by a moving camera, non-rigid structure from motion (NRSFM) aims to obtain the varying 3D structure and camera motion from uncalibrated 2D point tracks. 
				However, if the object deforms arbitrarily, reconstruction becomes under-constrained. Previous methods assume that the deforming structure could be reconstructed by a linear basis, the assumption Which is invalid in most real cases. 
				In this thesis, we aims to focus NRSFM on a specific defoming object, for example, human faces in the experiments, so that a pre-trained prior model could be available. 
				We categorize 2D point tracks into two groups, namely, well-defined landmarks and detected interesting points, and tackle the problem by two steps. First, we model the 3D structure of well-defined landmarks in probabilistic framework 
				and then optimize it by MAP manner to obtain initial structure and camera motion. Second, we jointly optimize the 3D structure of well-defined landmarks and detected interesting points and refine camera motion by 
				introducing suface constraint and distance constraint into final optimization. We further reconstruct a complete surface by fitting the surface model to the estimated structer points and a novel view of surface could be synthesized.</font>

      <font size='4'><b>Figure 1.</b> The overview of our method. We extract two kind of feature points at first, namely, well-defined landmarks and detected interesting points, and then forward them to our two-step NRSFM algorithm. 
      	Furthermore, we recover the complete surface by constraining the surface to pass the reconstructed structure points.

			<h2>Result</h2>
			
			<div><font size='4' face="times new roman">We evaluate our method on BU-3DFE and BU-4DFE datasets, both of which contain images and associated 3d models for several individuals with six expressions. 
				Since the models in BU-4DFE are temporally varying 3D human faces with expression deformations, we generate testing videos from BU-4DFE and use BU-3dFE for training.</font>
